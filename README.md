### Setup
Simply click this [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=208460637368614913&scope=bot&permissions=0xFFFFFFFFFFFF) to add DrumBot to your server (you need the Manage Server permission to do so)

By default DrumBot doesn't have many commands to use. The server owner must enable individual modules to allow use. Try using the commands `~module` to list all available modules, and `~module enable <Module>` to enable them.
